This is a readme for the 0x03-debugging directory.
The directory contains:
main.h : a header file containing function prototypes
0-main.c: a program that checks the functioning of a sign checking function
1-main.c: program that causes an infinite loop
2-largest_number.c: a program that prints out the largest of three integers
3-print_remaining_days.c: a program that converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into            consideration.
